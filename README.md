# ðŸ‘‹ Jacob Hallum

Hi there! Iâ€™m Jacob Hallum â€” a software developer with a strong focus on building sports applications and real-time systems.

## âš½ GameWatchr (In Progress)

Iâ€™m currently working on **[GameWatchr](https://github.com/jacohallum/GameWatchr)**, a personalized sports website designed to give users full control over notifications, team tracking, and event highlights across all major sports. The project includes full-stack development using:

* **Next.js** with **TypeScript**
* **PostgreSQL** and **Prisma**
* Secure authentication with **NextAuth**
* Planned AI features like smart alerts and sentiment analysis

## ðŸ¥‹ UFC Live Event Tracker

In parallel, Iâ€™ve developed a **UFC Fight Tracker**, which offers:

* **Live event detection**
* **Round-by-round breakdowns**
* **Real-time result alerts**
* **Discord bot integration**

This system interacts with the ESPN API and uses persistent caching and optimized polling logic to ensure timely and accurate updates.

## ðŸŽ® PipeMan

I also enjoy making games. One of my favorite personal projects is **[PipeMan](https://jcbh0.itch.io/pipeman)** â€” a quirky, puzzle-inspired platformer I developed with a unique control scheme and aesthetic.
