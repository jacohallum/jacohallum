# Jacob Hallum

Hi, I’m Jacob Hallum — a software developer who builds real-time systems and sports applications. I focus on creating tools that deliver live data, smooth performance, and reliable results.

## FightWatchr (In Progress)

**[FightWatchr](https://github.com/jacohallum/fightwatchr)** is a full-stack UFC hub that lets users manage notifications, track fighters, and view event highlights across all events.
It is built with:

* **Next.js** and **TypeScript**
* **PostgreSQL** with **Prisma ORM**
* Secure sign-in through **NextAuth**
* Planned features for AI-driven alerts and sentiment insights

## UFC Fight Tracker

**UFC Fight Tracker** scans official UFC sources to detect new fight announcements, lineup changes, and event updates as they happen.
It focuses on reliable data tracking and clear automation.

Key features include:

* Automatic detection of new events and fights
* Tracking for lineup updates, cancellations, and replacements
* Caching to prevent duplicate alerts
* **Discord** and **Twitter** integrations for notifications
