My name is Jacob Hallum. 

I am currently working on a sports website called GameWatchr and building live event tracking systems for UFC events.

I have a passion for video games and worked on creating a very special game: PipeMan. https://jcbh0.itch.io/pipeman

Recently, I've been developing a comprehensive UFC Live Event Tracker that provides real-time fight statistics, round-by-round analysis, and instant result notifications through Discord integration.
